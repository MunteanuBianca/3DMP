# Final Project - Horse Automata

## This is a readme.md for the final project of the 3D Modeling and Printing course
I chose the Horse Automata project because it looks elegant and appropriate for my skills in 3D modelling

The initial design was created by Greg Zumwalt and can be found 
on his [youtube accont](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtO8aX2QzzY).
Furthermore, he uploaded stl files with all the components and instructions for the assembly, which have been usefull in understanding and recreating the mechanism. the files and instructions can be found on various sites such as [Instructables](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqblBlS0NLc04tVERLbnpKdlB5X2xOSXBVZDROZ3xBQ3Jtc0trcXRiVG5DR1c4ai1WeDJ4M2g1QVpHY1dfUzZzdnJ6dFpTTHl3elRUellzeXNLV0RwSVlKcm5KdFRKR3lVNkE0a01OR19oTlNHX2VWZUthQ2NkZ1BXYjBGcVRZYjc2d2Qtd0tXektYeHQ0bHhsa1BXNA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instructables.com%2Fid%2FHorse-Prototype%2F), [YouMagazine](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDZYWENka0hKSHJlbzdmbllOd3RaWlJ3MGx3QXxBQ3Jtc0tuY1o3cWtXbmk4aWU1Q1I0S0p4YzMzNlBCbkpid1BzUUpRNDZlczA5RGVLZ2hTT2hwRC1OSXNDckNLT0I3WU45b0ZjQUJBUGw0QWVjdmpXR3RJRWxPRmFZRzRNYVVpRk1vUHJMYkdNNll1eGNtejRWVQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youmagine.com%2Fgzumwalt%2Fdesigns) and [Thingiverse](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmlMektFaVVTRkJnblA1WmwwS0VaaEVERDBkZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttTnFPYXkxaC1JTUVCR0JSRUJhS0RzY0QtWVJPeEhTYlhYeTY1azAyMlg0aFF4UDFhLXJFQktYc0JxZ2hQWTNpck5WaDhuMmNTRkZBblJWN2tOeHZRY2o3UnpVdWxHTmFZR1hCb3B4bnhDbXpRR1FNSQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thingiverse.com%2Fthing%3A2868613)

## Horse Automata Components
The main components in this project are the Body, Head, Tail, Legs and Holder.
With the exception of the Head and Tail, every component has multiple subcomponents inside it. 

```
## Holder
This is the first component that i started with. Inside it there are the base, housing motor and gear. 
The base is the horizontal part that is grounded and sustians the whole construction. It has a hole in the middle where the housing motor will be placed. The inside of the body is empty to reduce the usage of plastic.
The housing motor is the vertical part of the holder in wich the motor and gear will be placed. the body will be fixed on the upper part of the housing motor using screws and the other components will fixed on the body. 
The gear is linked to the motor wich makes it rotate and eventually, creates the entire motion of the horse.
