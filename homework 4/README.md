# Homework 4

## Task 1-The Scotch Yoke Mechanism
### I created The Scotch Yoke Mechanism using this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhX-8RyP214)
### In some components there are more than one bodies. This is because the object would be difficult to print, but it would be easy to print parts of it and glue it together after.
### They are bodies in one component and not different components because when I created them I considered them to be one object.
### The video tutorial was created with Video editor and the text is heavily inspired from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_yoke)

## Task 2-The Rod Crank Gear Mechanism
### This is the task where we had to choose one mechanism from a list of many and I choose [The Rod Crank Gear Mechanism](https://tinyurl.com/y7jvyma3)
### After some research I found out the name of it was the one mentioned, I did not come up with it.
### I split the crank into three bodies so it can be printed easier, but it was meant to be one object.
### I did not find a lot of information about this mechansim in particular, so I improvised in the video tutorial.
