# Homework 3
### In the Chess Set file I added the stl of each chess piece (pawn, rock, knight, bishop, queen, king) and the f3d of the project.
### Every piece was made following the sketch (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_5efPWQnSpA4AdFbwL6o2G25_VmKYOtj/view?usp=sharing)
### I also created the board, multiplied the pieces, gave them appearences and arranged them on the board.
